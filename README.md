This repo contains the source code for the Embedded Systems Development coursework.

Smart thermostatic controller using the PIC QL200 development board. 

### This code provides the following features: 
• Setting of current time and date 
• Display of current temperature 
• Display of current time and date 
• Entry of a trigger temperature 
• Output control for a heating circuit: When the temperature drops below the selected trigger temperature for a given duration of time the heating control output will be turned on and three short beeps are produced as confirmation. The given duration of time is adjustable from 0 to 90 seconds. 
• When the temperature rises above the selected trigger temperature for a given duration of time the heating control output will be turned off and 2 long beeps are produced as confirmation. The given duration of time is adjustable from 0 to 60 seconds.
